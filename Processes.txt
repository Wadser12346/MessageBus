Bootup:
Main uses Client.fxml to create the UI window
Main instantiates and activates a Client object on its own thread

Connection Attempt:
User types server name, port number, and username into fields on Client UI
User hits Connect button
ClientController takes text from those fields and packages it into a ConnectionAttempt object
ClientController packages that in an InternalPacket object and sends to ClientUIMain
ClientUIMain then reads the packet, and determines that it is a ConnectionAttempt object.
ClientUIMain gives the ConnectionAttempt to the Client object
Client will attempt to connect using the information
If it is successful, then client.main() will be called.

User from Client UI will select a chatroom from a drop down list and click the button open
Client UI will notify ClientUIMain that user wishes to open a new chatwindow.
